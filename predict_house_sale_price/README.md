This Python project predicts house sale prices using machine learning. It includes data cleaning, one-hot encoding of categorical features, and training three models: Linear Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning. Finally, it creates a Voting Regressor to leverage the strengths of all three models for improved prediction accuracy.
