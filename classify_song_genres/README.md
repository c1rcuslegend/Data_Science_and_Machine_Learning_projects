This project utilizes machine learning methods to train a classifier that distinguishes between two genres based solely on track information derived from Echonest. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by logistic regression and decision trees for genre prediction. Cross-validation is used to evaluate the performance of the models.
