Building a regression model for a DVD rental firm to predict rental duration involves several steps. First, we preprocess the data. Then, we use Lasso regression to select the most relevant features. Next, we train four models on the chosen features: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, K-Neighbors Regressor, and a Voting Regressor that combines the predictions of the previous models. Finally, we evaluate the models to choose the one with the best performance.
